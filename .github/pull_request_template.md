    1.  Subject is separated from body by a blank line
    2.  Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including issue reference)
    3.  Subject does not end with a period
    4.  Subject uses the imperative mood ("add", not "adding")
    5.  Body wraps at 72 characters
    6.  Body explains "what" and "why", not "how"

### Documentation
